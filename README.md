# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

# Situation:
Identified the need to develop a machine-learning model for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction.

# Task:
- The goal was to analyze a dataset containing breast cancer patients' clinical and protein expression data.
- The dataset had missing values, and categorical features, and needed preprocessing.
- I aimed to build a predictive model to classify patients as "Dead" or "Alive" based on various features.

# Action:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and content.
   - Handled missing values for numerical features.(explored K-nearest neighbor imputation as a possible solution for the same)
   - Mapped categorical features to numerical values.
   - Visualized key insights, including gender distribution, tumor stage, histology, and surgery types.

2. Model Building:
   - Split the data into training and test sets (80-20 split).
   - Utilized the Random Forest Classifier (RF) algorithm for classification.
   - Trained the RF model on the training data.
   - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and classification reports.

3. Predictions:
   - Used the trained model to make predictions for new data.
   - Provided user-friendly predictions indicating whether a patient is "Dead" or "Alive."

# Result:
- Successfully developed a Breast Cancer Survival Prediction model.
- The model achieved 81.54% on the test set.
- The project demonstrated strong data preprocessing skills, machine learning model selection, and predictive analysis capabilities.

This project highlights my expertise in data preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world healthcare challenges using data-driven approaches.
